
We are going to test all the ideas around fine-tuning, embeddings and hallucinations in chatgpt to have a better understanding on how to use the model for specific tasks. 

Fine tuning process summary: 

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: You start by collecting a large dataset of text that is relevant to the task or domain you want to fine-tune the model for. This dataset should be well-structured and cleaned as needed. For example, it may involve removing irrelevant content, handling special characters, and tokenizing the text into smaller units (e.g., words or subwords).
- Tokenization: The text data is tokenized, meaning it is divided into smaller units or tokens. These tokens are usually words or subwords, depending on the tokenization method used.
- Vectorization: Each token in the text is converted into a numeric representation. This is often done using techniques like Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or subword embeddings (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding or SentencePiece). These embeddings map words or subwords to dense vectors in a continuous space.
- Fine-Tuning: The model, such as ChatGPT, is then fine-tuned using the vectorized dataset. During fine-tuning, the model's weights are updated based on the specific task or domain you are interested in. This step helps the model adapt to the specific characteristics of the data and task.- Evaluation: After fine-tuning, the model is evaluated to ensure that it performs well on the desired task or domain. This may involve using validation datasets and metrics specific to the task.
- Deployment: Once the fine-tuning process is successful, the model can be deployed for its intended use, whether it's chatbot development, content generation, or another natural language processing task.
